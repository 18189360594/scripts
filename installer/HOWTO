Setup environment variables: 
 IN_VERSION is the version of fink you want to install, as a numerical
 value such as 0.4.5

 IN_BASEDIR is the directory containing this script (full pathname, with
 no trailing slash).  You are going to need /sw to be clear for this 
 installation, so if you move /sw to another location such as /sw.orig, 
 be sure to reset IN_BASEDIR to the correct value.

Step 1:
 Clear out /sw so that a fresh version can be installed there.

Step 2:
 Download fink-IN_VERSION-full.tar.gz from sourceforge (or use the copy
 you generated when building the srcdist), unpack it and run ./bootstrap.sh,
 installing into /sw. 

Step 3:
 Run "fink update-all" in case there were updates to base-packages since
 the last package manager release.

Step 4:
 Remove /sw/fink/dists/local/bootstrap as well as any .deb's in
 /sw/fink/dists/crypto/binary-darwin-powerpc/ or 
 /sw/fink/dists/main/binary-darwin-powerpc/* , and then remove all symlinks
 from /sw/fink/debs

Step 5:
 Remove /sw/src/*

Step 6:
 Run "fink scanpackages" to properly prepare for distribution.

Step 6:
 Check permissions in your /sw directory to verify things are world-readable 
 when appropriate

Step 6a:
 Run "chmod 1755 IN_BASEDIR/contents" to get the permissions of the 
 "contents" directory to match those of / on the target machine.

Step 7:
 Move the entire /sw directory into a subdirectory of IN_BASEDIR/contents 
 (that is, you should have a directory IN_BASEDIR/contents/sw/ when you are 
 finished).

Step 8.
 Run "./in_setup.sh" to create fink-IN_VERSION.pmsp

Step 9.
 Use TextEdit to examine the files in the resources and dmg subdirectories
 of this directory, editing if necessary.  You will need to change version
 numbers, and you will need to edit the list of installed packages which
 appears at the end of resources/ReadMe.rtf. Additionally you may need to update 
 the VolumeCheck file and localized error .strings files to contain the 
 minimum supported system version. (eg, 6C115 for 10.2.0)

Step 10.
 "open fink-IN_VERSION.pmsp" should launch PackageMaker, and you can make
 the .pkg file, whose name should be "Fink IN_VERSION Installer.pkg".
 Put it in the dmg subdirectory.

Step 11.
 Use DiskCopy to create an empty .dmg, 40 MB in size.  The Volume name should
 be "Fink IN_VERSION Installer" and the file name doesn't matter.  When
 the volume has been created, open it in the Finder, copy the contents of 
 the dmg subdirectory to it (except for the CVS directory of course), and 
 then drag it to the Trash.

Step 12.
 Launch DiskCopy again, and select "Convert Image".  You want to convert
 the .dmg you just created to "read/only", and give it the new name
 fink-IN_VERSION-installer.dmg.

That's it, you're done!  Be sure to commit your revised versions of the .rtf
files to CVS for the benefit of future releases.
