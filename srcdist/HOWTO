Q: How do I make a new source release of the Fink package manager?

A: Assuming you want to release fink 0.32.4, you first need to get the "fink"
and "scripts" modules from github, if you don't have them already:

 $ git clone git@github.com:fink/fink.git
 $ git clone git@github.com:fink/scripts.git

 $ cd fink 
 $ git checkout branch_0_32
 $ git pull
 
 Now that you're in branch_0_32 and current:
   -> edit VERSION so that it contains "0.32.4.git"
   -> edit NEWS to provide a user-friendly indication of the changes that
   	  have been made since the last release.
   -> push your changes upstream and prepare for release	  
 
 $ git commit -a
 $ git push
 $ git tag -m "Release 0.32.4" release_0_32_4
 $ git push origin release_0_32_4
 $ cd ../scripts/srcdist
 $ ./dist-module.pl --github fink 0.32.4

This will create the file /tmp/fink-0.32.4.tar.gz, and also various files
such as /tmp/fink-10.7.info .

The file fink-0.32.4.tar.gz now needs to be uploaded to the Sourceforge
File Release System.  (The instructions for that change rather frequently
so they are not given here.  Ask on the #fink IRC channel or the
fink-core mailing list.)

Once fink-0.32.4.tar.gz has propagated to the Sourceforge FRS mirrors,
test things using fink-10.7.info (or whatever the appropriate file is for
your OS X version) on your local system.  Assuming all is OK, you can commit
the various fink-NN.info files to their appropriate locations.

Q: What about releasing other modules, such as base-files?

A: Done in exactly the same way, using the appropriate module, e.g.
"base-files", instead of "fink".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AKH:  Possibly not current.
Q: How do I make a full distribution source release?

A: Assume you want to release the distribution release 0.7.1, under 
distribution 10.3, and also assume that the current version of the package 
manager is 0.21.2. 

In the following I assume you are in the directory containing the checkouts.


  cd dists/10.3
  echo "0.7.1.cvs" >VERSION
   -> now edit the ChangeLog as well
  cvs commit
  cvs tag release_0_7_1
  cd ../scripts/srcdist
  ./dist-module.sh dists/10.3 0.7.1
    -> this produces /tmp/dists-10.3-0.7.1.tar.gz
  ./dist-full.sh 0.7.1 0.21.2 10.3
    -> this produces /tmp/fink-0.7.1-full.tar.gz
