Q: How do I update the package database?

A: We can't run the full package DB update process on SourceForge's shell servers,
since it requires some parts of fink to run, which in turn need perl 5.6.
But SF only has an older perl version, and that won't change until debian
incorporates perl 5.6 into their stable distro.

First, some setup you have to perform exactly once.

First you should ssh into shell.sourceforge.net. There you need to create two
helper files (you only have to do that once):

~/bin/finksql:
#!/bin/sh
exec mysql -h mysql.sourceforge.net -u fink --password=DBPASSWORD fink

~/.finkdbi:
DBI:mysql:database=fink;host=mysql.sourceforge.net|fink|DBPASSWORD

You probably should chmod go-rw the two files, and also chmod u+x the finksql
script. If you don't know the value for "DBPASSWORD", ask the project admin.

Now, checkout the pdb  module from CVS into your home directory:
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs1:/cvsroot/fink co pdb

Logout from SSH. You know have to edit the "upload" script by replacing
"fingolfin" with your SourceForge login name. Finally edit fink.conf and make
sure the Basepath in it points to some sensible place (in the directory you
give there, a "fink" tree will be created via cvs checkout).

That should be it for the one time setup. Now to the regular update procedure.
I assume you are in the scripts/pdb 
directory (the same this HOWTO is in).

Simply run
  ./refresh
Verify that everything went smooth. In particula, current.sql should *not* be
empty. If you are sufficiently sure all is fine, you can now run
  ./upload
  ssh MYSFUSERNAME@shell.sourceforge.net /home/users/f/fi/fingolfin/bin/pdbupdate

The last script will just cd into $HOME/pdb and run inject.pl from there. If you
prefer, you can do this manually, too.

That should be it!

Q: How do I update the PDB for a full fink release?

A: Assuming you just released fink 0.4.5, you'll want to adjust the package
database accordingly. 

Run this from your local pdb directory (replace 0.4.5 as appropriate):
 ./dumprelease 0.4.5

This will produce a file called 0.4.5-stable.sql. Upload this file to your
SourceForge account. Next, you must update the releases.sql file for 0.4.5
(just replace the current version with the new one). Once you did this, log
into shell.sf.net, and run these commands (order is important):

 /home/users/f/fi/fingolfin/bin/finksql < releases.sql
 /home/users/f/fi/fingolfin/bin/finksql < 0.4.5-stable.sql

Now run the "flag" script (which can be found in the same directory as
this HOWTO); alternatively, just run pdbupdate as outlined above:

 ssh MYSFUSERNAME@shell.sourceforge.net /home/users/f/fi/fingolfin/bin/pdbupdate

Finally, you have to tell the PHP script which renders the package description
pages to display the information from 0.4.5 along with the current data. To do
so, edit "pdb/releases.inc" in the "web" CVS module.

That's it.
